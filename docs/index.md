# Models of the ventral stream that categorized and visualize images
> [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.958488v1.full)

## Abstract

A widely held view in visual systems neuroscience is that the ventral stream (VS) of mammalian visual cortex maps visual inputs onto firing patterns that specify object identities. Recent experiments, however, showed that information about object positions, sizes, etc. is encoded with increasing explicitness along this pathway. Here, we show that computational models that identify objects while also retaining enough information about the input image to allow its reconstruction, can provide a better description of how primate VS represents this category-orthogonal information, than do models that “just” identify objects. A thorough understanding of VS computations might thus require considerations beyond object recognition.
